# Module 14
## In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs found depending on the selection in the dropdown menu. The graph is represented by the sample_values vs otu_ids.

The bubble chart represents the otu_ids vs sample_values, also showing the results depending on the dropdown menu subject.

The demographic information panel updates whenever a new Subject ID is selected.
